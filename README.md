# [Refokus Challenge](https://refokuschallenge.netlify.app/)

For this challenge, I created two tools: a filter tool, and a filler tool.

With the filter tool, you'll be able to search and filter by your favourite Pokémons (yes, those lovely creatures of your childhood). Search for ANY (and when I mean ANY, I mean ANY) Pokémon that you want, and filter by its stats, combining them in any crazy order that you can imagine!

And with the filler tool, you can quote practically any company stock that you want! And of course, get all the details about it.
